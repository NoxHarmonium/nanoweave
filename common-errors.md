# Common Errors

A list to keep track of errors 
that happen to me frequently
and give esoteric error messages
that dont help.

I'll use this list when
I get up to writing better diagnostics.

- Accidental missed comma between statements in object
- Chaining lambdas together without putting brackets around the body
- Invalid operands to functions and operators
